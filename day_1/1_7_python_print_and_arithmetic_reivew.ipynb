        "   - Select a name that is both concise and descriptive. This helps in understanding the purpose and contents of the variable.\n",
        "   - Variable names cannot contain spaces. For example, \"test var\" is not allowed.\n",
        "   - Variable names can only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. Special characters like exclamation marks or punctuation are not permitted. For instance, \"test_var!\" is not allowed.\n",
        "   - Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore. They cannot start with a number. For example, \"1_var\" is not allowed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Creating a Variable:\n",
        "   - To create a variable, you use the assignment operator `=` to assign a desired value to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Viewing Variable Values:\n",
        "   - You can examine the value assigned to a variable by using the `print()` function and passing the variable name as an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you gain experience, you'll become more proficient in selecting meaningful and appropriate names for your Python variables. Initially, it may feel uncomfortable, but exposure to different Python code will help you improve your naming skills.\n",
