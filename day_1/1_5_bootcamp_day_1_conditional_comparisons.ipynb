        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will explore the concepts of conditionals and comparisons in Python. Conditionals allow us to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Comparisons, on the other hand, enable us to compare values and determine their relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will cover the following topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Conditional Statements: if, elif, else\n",
        "2. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=\n",
        "3. Logical Operators: and, or, not\n",
        "4. Nested Conditionals: Multiple levels of conditions\n",
        "5. Chained Comparisons: Combining multiple comparisons in a single statement\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conditional Statements: if, elif, else\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements allow us to control the flow of our program based on certain conditions. The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The `elif` statement provides additional conditions to check, and the `else` statement is used as a fallback when all other conditions are false.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 5\n",
